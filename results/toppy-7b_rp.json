Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long? Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.\" Based on this, a fun thing to do in San Francisco would be to spend quality time with your kids, as the author suggests that life is too short to waste on bullshit and that having kids shows us how short life actually is.
